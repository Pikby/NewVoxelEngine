The following are a bunch of examples of the engine in work!



### Procedural Generation
![procedural](Demos/procedural.gif)

The engine uses a 3d chunk map which allows for procedural generation in all axises, implementing FastNoises simd instruction for fast noise generation


### Destructibility
![destructible](Demos/destructible.gif)

The engine allows for on the fly destructibility and creation of voxels on the fly, 


### Accurate Physics
![physics](Demos/physics.gif)

The engine implements bullet3s physics engine, using a 1 to 1 collision mesh for the world which allows for very procise collision

### Real Time Shadows
![Point shadows](Demos/PointShadows.gif)

The engine also implements Dynamic point and dirctional shadows to allow for an interesting and ever changing light scape

### And alot more
The engine also implements procedurally generate clouds and water waves which can be found throughout the environments.

Alot more in the works so stay tuned!
